Hello <%= username %>,

We have just received a request to reset your password for your account at <%- config.siteName %> (<%- config.host %>).

If you forgot your password and need to reset it, follow the link below:

<%- config.web.linkHost + '/#/resetPassword/' + email + '/' + token %>

If you did not request this password reset, just ignore this email; the link will expire after 24 hours.

Cheers,
<%- config.siteName %> team
